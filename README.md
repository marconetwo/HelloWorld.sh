# HelloWorld.sh
My attempt to jump ahead left me confused, Soooo, Goto Beginning -- Hello World as a "bash" shell script

# Initial coding: I'm simply following the "Hello-World" tutorial.  It's been a while and trying to jump
# Ahead without following a simple tutorial was like trying to operate a mixing board where all the labels
  next to the buttons and sliders have been removed.  I know you don't learn a language by simpply reading
  a user manual, one has to start programming hands on WITH the manual right next to you.  This has been
  fairly painless so far...
  
  So stating this is the first commit.  Next will be creating and commiting a new file, "hello_world.sh"
  containing the expected two lines of shell code... - (mpt)
